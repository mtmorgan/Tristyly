Description: Tristyly is a plant polymorhism in which there are three
    floral 'morphs': Long (long stigma, mid and short anthers), Mid
    (mid stigma, long and short anthers), and Short (short stigma,
    long and mid anthers). The genetics of many systems is
    well-understood, typically involving two epistatic loci with
    dominance, such that the ssmm genotype is Long, ssM- is Mid, and
    S--- is Short. Mating is dissasortative between morphs, e.g., Long
    mates with Mid and Short more frequently than random. The package
    implements these features to allow simulation of morph ration
    dynamics in finite populations.
